If you are in a dark environment, you can hold down the `ENTER` button of the M5StickV or Maix Amigo to turn on their LED light to potentially increase visibility. Some cameras (`OV7740`, `OV2640` and `GC2145`) have an anti-glare mode to better capture images from high brightness screens or with incident light, they are present on M5StickV, Amigo, Cube, Yahboom and WonderMV. To enable/disable the anti-glare mode on a supported device just press the `PAGE` button while scanning.
